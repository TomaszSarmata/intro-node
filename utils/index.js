// import { other } from "./other";
// import { count, somethingElse } from ".utils";

// export { other, count, somethingElse };
// We can do it as above to centralise imports and exports through index.js. But even faster and cleaner would be as below. That imports and exports everything automatically

export { other } from "./other";
export { count, somethingElse } from ".utils";
